# codmetric_Expert-System-for-computer-diagnosis

Developed as part of my internship at **Codmetric (May–June 2025)**, this is a rule-based expert system built using Python and Tkinter. It helps diagnose computer boot issues such as RAM failure, bootloader corruption, or power supply faults through a friendly GUI interface.

# Expert System for Computer Diagnosis 🖥️ 

This project simulates how real-world expert systems work by using **if-then rules** to map user-reported symptoms to potential hardware/software issues. It is interactive, informative, and designed to be beginner-friendly.

---

### 💡 Key Features

- Interactive diagnosis through GUI (Tkinter)
- Covers multiple boot issue categories like:
  - RAM/Hardware Failure
  - Bootloader/OS Corruption
  - Power Supply Issue
- Uses rule-based logic to assign confidence scores
- Provides a summary, explanation, and recommended fix
- Saves diagnosis report to a `.txt` file (if supported by system encoding)
